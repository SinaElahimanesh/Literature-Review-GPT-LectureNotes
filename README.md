# A Literature Review on LLMs and Lecture Note Generation

## Overview

The collections contained herein have been personally compiled without the aid of web crawlers or any form of automated gathering software. These curated lists are intended to serve as a starting point for researchers looking for references, inspiration, and a comprehensive background of work in their area of interest.

Please note that these lists are not exhaustive. They represent a snapshot of a continually evolving field, gathered to the best of my ability and knowledge.

## Repository Use and Citations

Before diving into the content, we kindly ask you to review the terms outlined in the **LICENSE** file within this repository. If you find any of the papers useful for your research and opt to cite them, a citation of this repository is required. 

Furthermore, it's important to mention that the creation of surveys or literature reviews directly from the papers listed here is not permitted. This repository is intended solely as a resource for research papers, particularly to support the "Related Work" sections.

## Paper Descriptions

The provided summaries for each paper are crafted for brevity and may not always mirror the titles of the papers. Where deemed necessary, snippets from abstracts—or the main text in the case of open-access papers—have been used to capture the essence of the work. Occasionally, these excerpts have been slightly modified for clarity and conciseness.

It is possible that some papers are listed more than once if they touch upon multiple relevant topics. We urge you to review the papers thoroughly before citing them. While we strive for accuracy, there is no guarantee that the lists are free from errors. Thus, any use of the content in this repository is at your own discretion and risk.
